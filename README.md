The open source refrigeration (heat pump) system

In this project, I will use STM32 + Micropython(maybe need Raspberry PICO) to design. Because I am not an all-round talent. Some work will be done by AI. Thanks to ChatGPT(/smile)

**All codes & Refrigeration designs will be open source!**

**Let everyone make the air conditioner they want.** I believe that open source can lead to progress.

The code is being updated
